# Knowleverage AI

## About

An **open source** framework for **growing knowledge bases** in **cooperation
with AI agents**.

For public or organizational information of any domain.

Use a **markdown repository** and let the agents help you

* **digesting new information** from **any source**, such as blog posts,
  Youtube videos or release tags,
* **extracting new knowledge** from those sources,
* adding that knowledge to the **markdown repository** in a **structured** way,
* thereby **re-organizing existing pages** where needed,
* including **references to the sources** digested.

There is also a **"This week in ..." recap** agent summarizing the latest
changes.

All with (default mode) or even without (demo mode) **human approval**.

Knowleverage AI is an **extendible Ruby on Rails 8 application** and *looking
for open source contributors*.

We are **passionate** about **learning, sharing knowledge and developing**.

This framework **enpowers** us to use **AI for leveraging** the **assimilation
of knowledge**.

Stay tuned!
